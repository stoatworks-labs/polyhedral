/**
    Logging for a plugin that lives inside somebody else's process.

    A small member of the fleet's `diag` family. The rest of the repos get a
    rotating log, a crash report and a diagnostics bundle; an FFGL effect gets
    only the log, for two reasons:

    - **No crash handler.** A plugin loaded into Resolume must not install a
      process-wide signal handler. It would intercept faults that are not ours
      and interfere with the host's own handling. A plugin has no business
      deciding what happens when Resolume dies.
    - **No bundle command.** There is no UI to hang one off -- an effect is a
      list of sliders in someone else's inspector.

    What it covers is the failure that actually happens: `InitGL` returning
    `FF_FAIL` because the shader would not compile, a font or a texture file
    that would not load. From the operator's side each of those looks like
    "the dice do nothing" or "my font did not take", with no message anywhere.
    The GL vendor and version strings go in next to it, because a shader that
    compiles on one machine and not on another is a driver answer, not a
    source answer. Each roll is logged too: its results, its trials and warp.
