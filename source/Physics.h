/**
    Rigid dice on a table: gravity, contacts, friction, restitution, sleep.

    Small and exact rather than general. Every body is a convex polyhedron with
    a known plane set, so a contact is either a vertex of one body that has
    crossed a plane of the other -- the table, a wall, a face of another die --
    or two dice's edges that have passed through each other (each edge's
    closest point inside the other die), pushed apart along the edges' common
    normal. Vertices and edges are the whole of convex-polyhedron contact; an
    insphere test backs both up for anything deeper than one step's travel.

    ## The step (960 Hz, four steps per keyframe at 240 Hz)

    1. Gravity into the velocities; the gyroscopic term for the d10, the one
       solid whose inertia is not isotropic.
    2. Contacts from the current positions.
    3. Sequential impulses: normal impulses accumulated and clamped >= 0, the
       restitution target taken from the approach speed before the solve,
       Coulomb friction clamped to mu times the normal impulse.
    4. **Split impulse**: penetration is pushed out with pseudo-velocities that
       move the positions and are then thrown away. Baumgarte's way (a bias in
       the real velocity) pushes the die out by giving it kinetic energy, which
       is a bounce nobody threw.
    5. Integration. A body touching nothing moves by v dt + g dt^2 / 2, which is
       exact for a parabola; `ditest --physics` holds free flight to it.

    **Contact impulses never add kinetic energy.** Per-point restitution at
    several simultaneous contacts can, in some orientations; when a solve leaves
    more kinetic energy than it found, it is solved again inelastically. The
    world counts how often (`Stats::inelasticRetries`).
