"""The demo's copies of the plugin must be the plugin, character for character.

    python3 demo/tools/check_shaders.py           compare; exit 1 on any drift
    python3 demo/tools/check_shaders.py --write   regenerate demo/shaders.js

Called from `tools/verify.sh`. Exit code 1 means a copy has drifted.

------------------------------------------------------------------- why

The page at polyhedral-demo.stoatworks-labs.com carries two things that are
copies of this repository, and copies drift quietly -- a die that renders a
*plausible* number looks exactly like one that renders the right one.

1. **The GLSL.** `demo/shaders.js` holds the five pieces of
   `source/Shaders.cpp` (kQuadVertex, kCommon, kDice, kMaterial, kFragment)
   plus kVersion. This compares them exactly -- no whitespace normalisation, no
   comment stripping: a comment updated on one side only is drift worth
   catching. The page checks the same thing again at run time, against the
   text the compiled plugin hands to glShaderSource (demo/wasm/gl_shim.cpp).

   The one transformation is a decode: a backtick cannot sit raw in a template
   literal, so shaders.js escapes it as \\`. Any other backslash, or a `${`, on
   the JS side is rejected; the C++ bodies hold neither. `--write` produces
   shaders.js from the C++ by exactly that escape, so the copy is spliced by
   this script and never typed.

2. **The WebAssembly.** `demo/polyhedral-core.wasm` is the plugin's C++
   compiled by `demo/tools/build-wasm.sh`, and committed, because the deploy has
   no build step. Building it needs emscripten, which verify.sh cannot assume,
   so this checks the next best thing: `demo/wasm/inputs.sha256`, written by the
   build, records the hash of every file that went in and of both outputs. A
   source file changed since the last build -- or an output that is not the one
   the build wrote -- fails here, and the fix is to rerun build-wasm.sh.

------------------------------------------------------------------- what it cannot

It cannot tell whether the .wasm really is what those inputs compile to (only
rebuilding can), and it says nothing about demo/plugin.js, the page around the
plugin: its panel is built from the plugin's own declarations at run time, but
its read-out units and its layout are the page's.
